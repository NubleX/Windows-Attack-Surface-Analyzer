A comprehensive, open-source PowerShell tool for analyzing Windows security posture and identifying potential attack vectors. Perfect for cybersecurity professionals, system administrators, and security-conscious users.

## What it Does

The Windows Attack Surface Analyzer performs a thorough security assessment of your Windows system, identifying:

- **Network Attack Vectors** - Open ports, listening services, and network exposure
- **Service Security** - Risky or unnecessary Windows services
- **Firewall Configuration** - Windows Firewall status and rule analysis
- **Network Shares** - SMB shares and file system exposure
- **Windows Features** - Potentially dangerous optional features
- **Startup Security** - Programs with system startup access
- **User Account Security** - Account policies and configurations
- **System Hardening** - Windows Defender, UAC, and update status

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10/11 or Windows Server 2016+
- PowerShell 5.1 or later
- Administrator privileges (recommended for complete analysis)

### Basic Usage

1. **Download the script:**
   ```powershell
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NubleX/Windows-Attack-Surface-Analyzer/main/WindowsAttackSurfaceAnalyzer.ps1" -OutFile "WindowsAttackSurfaceAnalyzer.ps1"
   ```

2. **Run the analysis:**
   ```powershell
